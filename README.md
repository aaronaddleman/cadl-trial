## inital thoughts

I tried this swagger/openapi generator and was not able to get off the ground in the first 5 minutes by copy+pasting examples. There were some errors and I did not really do it justice. After thinking about it a little longer, I dont see the real value in this. I have yet to play with other swagger examples or openapi tools. Once I do, maybe I will come back to this tool for more experients.
